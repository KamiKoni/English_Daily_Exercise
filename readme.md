## Scrum Master (Didier Diaz)

Good morning, everyone.  
Welcome to today’s Daily Scrum.

The purpose of this meeting is to review:
- What we worked on yesterday  
- What we will work on today  
- Any blockers or impediments  

Let’s keep it short and focused.  
Product Owner, please begin.

## Product Owner (Andres Botina)

Thank you.

Our product is a **Sales Register System for a Car Wash**.  
The main goal is to record services, control daily sales, and support better business decisions.

Yesterday, we reviewed the user stories related to the sales module.  
Today, we will validate that the current features align with business requirements.

There are no changes in priorities at the moment.

## Stakeholder (Jorge Hurtado)

From the business perspective, the system is very valuable.

It allows us to track:
- Daily income  
- Most popular services  
- Customer volume  

Yesterday, I reviewed the sales summary functionality.  
Today, I am waiting for the updated version to provide final feedback.

I don’t have any blockers.

## Developer Argenis Flores

Yesterday, I worked on the **sales registration form**.  
I implemented fields for:
- Service type  
- Price  
- Payment method  

However, I encountered issues related to **input validation**.  
Currently, the form allows empty fields, which could cause incorrect data.

Today, I will focus on:
- Debugging these validation issues  
- Improving validation logic  
- Ensuring data is stored correctly  

This is a **partial blocker**, and I may need support from Developer 2 to review the calculation logic.

## Developer Valentina Bolivar

Yesterday, I worked on the **daily sales report**, including total calculations and summaries.

Today, I will:
- Help Developer 1 with the calculation logic  
- Continue integrating the report with the database  

I don’t have any blockers.

---

## Scrum Master (Closing)

Thank you, team.

We have identified a partial blocker in the sales form, and the team is already working on it.  
Let’s stay aligned and support each other to resolve it quickly.

This concludes today’s Daily Scrum.
